# `songhay-core`

## core, shared JS module for studio client-side projects

In the same manner that the Songhay studio develops `[SonghayCore](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/SonghayCore)` for the desktop or server, here we have this repo for the JavaScript client (or Node server).

`typedoc` [documentation](./docs/index.html) is available.
